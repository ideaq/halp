The idea is to have an awesome stack trace when ever we call `halp()` or `halp(str)` or `halp(obj)` etc.

## Why?

Why do we need *another* logging library?

### Top 5 Reasons

1. ***Intuitive*** ([don't make me think!](http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758)) "*works like **console.log** but **much** cooler*" (***no learning curve***!);
2. ***Sensible defaults*** means it ***"Works out of the box"*** & *Nothing to configure* until you want to use more advanced options.
3. 
4. **Clarity** / **Simplicity** in both the code and tests
(easier to understand for beginners)
5. **

### Sample HALP! User Quotes 

> "***Wow***! *I didn't know that was* ***possible***! 
> ***HALP***! *has completely changed how I write node.js apps!*"

(this is what we *want* people to say...)

## Philosophy

### Sensible Defaults


### Evironment Variables as Settings


Run with environment variables *not* [config files](http://12factor.net/config).


###Â Output to Logstash
